# Setting up Instructions
1-Clone the Racket Rhythm repository to your local machine and use the last version contained in RacketRhythm_V1.0 folder to run needed commands. 
Note: src file under the master branch was used for development and initial testing and debugging for systems different devices.
2-Hardware Setup:
-Connect Adrafruit I2S MEMs Microphone breakout boards to Raspberry Pi GPIO pins according to provided specifications in the main README file.
-Use USB ports to connect the audio sound card then make sure to plug the speakers to the output channel of the audio sound card.
-For audio input, use any 3.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable to connect to your PC or mobilephone.
3-Software Setup:
Configure I2S settings on Raspberry Pi by editing /boot/firmware/config.txt and /etc/modules.
Compile kernel and install necessary dependencies.
4-Library Configuration:
Install required libraries such as Alsa, PortAudio, and FFTW.
5-Microphone Testing:
Use arecord command to record audio and aplay command to play back the recorded file for microphone testing.
6-Adjust the ID's of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices:  
Use aplay -l to check the list of connected hardware devices and change the below device numbers accordingly.
7-Compile/CMake:
Compile the RacketRhythm_V1.0 code using CMakeLists or any appropriate compiler.
8-Choose a Song:
Select your favourite song from Spotify or YouTube.
9-Run:
Run the compiled code to start the Racket Rhythm game experience.

# Key Features
* Music-driven gameplay.
* Targets amateur players improving on consistency.
* Dynamic Sound adjustments for players of all levels.

# Setup Instructions
**Hardware Requirements:**
 * Raspberry Pi
 * Adrafruit I2S MEMs Microphone breakout board - SPH0645 x2
 * Audio Sound Card - AU-MMSA
 * Speakers
 * 3.5mm to 3.5mm Audio Cable

**Software Requirements:**
 * C++ for Raspberry Pi control
 
**Hardware Setup:**

Adrafruit I2S MEMs Microphone breakout board-SPH0645 was used in this setup. 
Microphone breakout board documentation can be found here: [Adafruit I2S MEMS Microphone Breakout](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/adafruit-i2s-mems-microphone-breakout.pdf), and [SPH0645LM4H-B Rev C Datasheet](https://mm.digikey.com/Volume0/opasdata/d220001/medias/docus/908/SPH0645LM4H-B.pdf). GPIO pins connection are as follows:

```
Mic - RPi
---------
VCC - 3.3v
Gnd â€“ Gnd
BCLK - BCM 18 (pin 12)
DOUT - BCM 20 (pin 38)
LRCL - BCM 19 (pin 35)
SEL  - Mono: no connection needed
     - Stero: right channel 3.3v, left channel Gnd
```

**Software Setup:**
**I2S Configuration:**  
To enable I2S on Raspberry Pi some modifications are needed:

* Uncomment ```#dtparam=i2s=on``` in ``` sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt ```
* Add to a new line ``` dtoverlay=i2s-mmap  ``` and ``` dtoverlay=googlevoicehat-soundcard  ``` This sets up the I2S mapping and activates the I2S sound card overlay.
* Add ``` snd-bcm2835   ``` to ``` sudo nano /etc/modules ```

**Kernel Compiling:**

* Update and install necessary dependencies:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo rpi-update

# Check your Raspbian version:
$ gcc --version
gcc (Raspbian 12.2.0-14+rpi1) 12.2.0

# Mic dependencies that needed to be installed:
  $ sudo apt-get install bc
  $ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
  ```
